"05 Aug, 2021",Lynlee,"I‚Äôm new to the ‚Äúear climber‚Äù type of jewelry, and when saw these I was so excited to get them. However, when I saw they would be shipping from Greece to me, in California, I thought twice about it and initially decided against it. But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it and I took a chance and ordered from Artikats anyway! And OH MY GOSH, I‚Äôm sooo glad I did! First off, the craftsmanship is exquisite. These pieces (I bought two different types) are just beautiful. The artist is highly skilled at her craft! Secondly, the fit is perfect; they‚Äôre dainty and look so beautiful on the ear. But the most impressive part is that I received the package within a week of ordering, FROM GREECE TO THE US‚Ä¶with an expected date much further off. So, ORDER from Artikats, I‚Äôm so grateful I did! I HIGHLY recommend this shop! Thank you Artikats!",1
"28 Jun, 2020",Jo Johnson,"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too.

"15 Jul, 2021",Rita Webb,Absolutely lovely - beautifully made. This is my second purchase from ArtiKats and it won't be the last.,1
"22 Feb, 2021",meghanwhitney,"I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‚Äòback‚Äô, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received.",1

"18 Aug, 2017",bhelmens,"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all. I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!",1
"27 Feb, 2016",Jennifer Christensen,"Earrings came about 1 week after placing order (5d to CA). They're very pretty and unique, I'll definitely order again from this shop. Came with 2 pairs of rubber backings- perfect because I promptly flung one of the backings into the nether regions of my bathroom upon trying them on. Fits perfect. The bars are large, if you want a daintier look maybe go with a different stud combo (ie the leaves with a smaller bar).",1
"23 Sep, 2015",Christina Chung,"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!",1
"27 Sep, 2018",Svetlana Birca,"Lil bit bigger than I expected, but I like it very much! Thank you!",1

"08 Aug, 2021",corineclark,"Love these! I'm a psychiatric nurse practitioner, and I like being able to wear a depiction of my bread and butter. Can be a little difficult to position correctly, but not so much that it becomes a nuisance. Would recommend.",1

"25 Aug, 2021",Shannon Magill,"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!! However, because of the unique design, I lost the back to one the second time I wore it. I‚Äôve never in my adult life lost an earring back, so it‚Äôs not user error. I was so disappointed as I had waited a while before wearing them as I wanted to savor them.

The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it.",1
"31 Aug, 2021",Marcela,"The earrings look exactly as in the pictures. At first I was a little bit skeptical because the images look kind of digital enhanced but the earrings are really smooth and shiny like that. They look and feel of very good quality, they‚Äôre sturdy and they have a nice dazzling golden look. It‚Äôs the first ear crawlers I buy and I just realized that my ears might be too small for this size of earring, so next time I‚Äôll buy smaller ones. I‚Äôll use them, because they look so good anyways!",1
"04 May, 2017",Nicole,"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot.",1

They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

"08 Dec, 2015",tiffany brice,I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!,1
"13 Mar, 2021",Clara Hildebrand,"I absolutely love my earring crawler! It was well worth the wait. It's very light and doesn't hurt my ear to wear, which I was a little bit worried about, but it's so comfortable I've even accidentally slept with it in and didn't notice.

They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings).

"07 Aug, 2020",Ashley Starr Kinseth,"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!",1
"07 Mar, 2019",dearkatiedear,So pretty! It is more dainty in person than what I was imagining from the picture but I was pleasantly surprised! I am planning on wearing it at my wedding and it will match well with my other jewelry. Thank you!,1

"07 Jul, 2015",Karen Martwick,Adorable earrings in adorable packaging! They arrived quickly and are lovely; my only quibble is that the tiny ear climbers are a little too tiny for my plump earlobes. I flared them out and put them in my second holes and I think they're going to work!,1

"09 Jan, 2018",LL,"I orders two earrings and here is the picture for ones with dragonfly. The mono phrases- They are just damn great! It looks like Ara has worked on customer issues as the handles on my earrings seem superb (does not seem at all like they are going to come off as I read in some previous reviews). One seems to be a bit tight and hurts the ear if is kept too long, but I will just adjust the handle carefully, it should do the trick. In general they are a bit different from what I imagined and I am very hard to please client and do not leave 5 stars in general, but this item is really good and has the subtle ornamented silver that gives other qualities. Comes with a cute bottle that I was happy to receive even if the earrings did not fit so Ara added extra packaging. And a nice polishing cloth too. Thank you and good luck!",1

"06 Sep, 2017",Tesla Therrien,"These are literally so beautiful. I don't spend very much money on jewelry in general because I tend to lose it, but these just felt so special. They look great and feel great. I can't say enough good things.",1

"27 Feb, 2019",Erin,"These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)",1
"06 Dec, 2020",Erin Vasta,"These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!",1
"01 Oct, 2018",Claire Sonnier,"I love these earrings and had a great experience with the artist, Suzy. I already purchased these in silver and loved them so much I ordered in gold. When they arrived the back on one earring was a little loose and ended up falling off somewhere within just a couple hours. :( I reached out to Suzy and almost immediately she responded saying sorry for the inconvenience and she‚Äôd send me a new one. Very happy with the earrings and customer service!",0
"06 Jan, 2021",Sara,These are now my new favorite earrings! They‚Äôre made out of good quality materials but they don‚Äôt feel heavy when I put them on! Definitely will come back to get more from your shop!!!,1
"12 Nov, 2014",Anna Makulska-Worrall,Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them. I love the fact that you can rotate tiny wind mills like you would in real life :) Overall fast delivery. Top notch. I recommend the seller.,1
"22 Jul, 2013",Reviewed by Anonymous,"I love how the colour looks like in the product picture so I just choose the same colour ""Multicolor"". Now I quote the seller's words when he replied my question about ""Multicolor"": ""When I make a pair of pinwheel earrings in multicolor the color shades are blue - violet - gold at the bottom of the windmill and gold - teal on the top."" So the real products don't really have the same look as in the picture, but they are still beautiful, with ombre effect ;)",0
"24 Oct, 2014",Whitney Svoboda,This item took a while to get to me but I love it!! Totally worth the wait. The attention to detail in the earrings is amazing. They are gorgeous. I am extremely happy!!,1

"14 May, 2018",caylerbean,"The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It‚Äôs maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It‚Äôs kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger.",0

"30 Jun, 2018",Jenn Jordan,"Updated - Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani! Original Post July 30 ""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures. In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring. However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them.""",1
"19 Sep, 2017",Deimante Pet,"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice.

"11 Dec, 2020",astrid,"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr sch√∂n - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter gr√∂√üter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke...",0
"19 Feb, 2018",justineatreadwell,"These are so perfect! Shani was very flexible with me changing my mind and wanting two pairs at the same time and was kind enough to refund me the shipping for the second purchase so they could be sent together. Beautiful little pieces, and a pleasure to deal with Shani!",1

I love them! The international delivery and correspondence was very quick. I'm already trying to work out my next Glamrocks Designs purchase - thank you!,1
"08 Nov, 2016",Liz Lux,"These are super cute - they were a tiny bit wider than I anticipated but not significantly. Since these were my first pair of ear crawlers it took me a few times to get the hang of putting them in, but I've gotten better at it each time. I've gotten so many compliments on these.. wish I had bought more :)",1

"20 Dec, 2019",xpuctr,"I LOVE these ear jackets! As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since! They are very well made, and I just love the look. I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper). They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured. Either way is great - don't hesitate! Virginia, thanks for making these for me!",1
"28 Oct, 2020",Karen Wysopal,"Beautiful handmade earrings. My earlobes are kind of small so the ball spheres hang down a little lower than shown in the picture, but they are really cool anyway.

"22 Feb, 2021",meghanwhitney,"I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‚Äòback‚Äô, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received.",1

"23 Sep, 2016",Cate Epperson,BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments. The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!,1

"29 Jun, 2017",Alex Taylor,"Absolutely stunning earings!!! My only complaint: while the clamp style backing on the top of the earing is great for keeping it in place, it is slightly uncomfortable. That said, I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again.",1

"16 Mar, 2019",Brianna,These are even more beautiful in person. I got two pairs. One yellow gold (left) and one white gold (right). Both hammered. The hammered effect makes the light hit them at different angles and gives them a little sparkle. They can be dressed up or down. The shop owner is amazing and communication is fantastic! Highly recommend!,1

"14 May, 2018",Pippa McKechnie,"I had not considered a pair of ear climbers before spotting these... something about the shape in the photo just spoke to me, and they are every bit as beautiful in reality. I have a fairly neutral skin tone but tend to wear silver. I bought these in the hammered gold because I reckoned this would give a softer glow of gold, which it does (and it was an occasion for spoiling myself). They feel superb in the hand and look gorgeous on. More of a subtle and elegant touch than a statement piece, I know I am going to get loads of use from them. They shipped much faster than promised too.",1

"10 May, 2017",hrimcealde,"love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped. Went in easter basket.",1
"19 Apr, 2021",ecshiver,"These are beautiful! I love that they're uniquely shaped earrings made from titanium. They don't bother my ears. The only thing of note is that the posts are a little thicker than I'm used to, so that took some adjustment time. Overall very happy with this purchase.",1

"29 Jan, 2021",Elisabeth,Great little earrings! I was nervous because I wanted to wear these in my third holes but they are small enough that they look great even that far up my earlobe without going into the part where my ear curls over. Comfy enough to sleep in (though I usually turn them face down) which is what I wanted and it was really hard to find a climber earring that didn't have a stud back. The back also is adjustable for how tight it is which is nice and no irritation from wearing them for a long time. Highly recommend!,1

"14 Mar, 2021",Irina G.,"Die Ohrringe sind wundersch√∂n und entsprechen dem Bild. Auch die Verk√§uferin ist sehr freundlich. Leider ist hier kein Silber Stempel. Weswegen man darauf vertrauen muss, dass es echtes Silber ist. Nur deswegen gebe ich 4 Sterne (weil ich dahingehend schon schlechte Erfahrungen hatte..jedoch nichtig Etsy).Nat√ºrlich musste auch Zoll dazu bezahlt werden. Sonst g√§be es 5",0

The second time I wore just the one with m hair up, and it wasn‚Äôt until I adjusted my mirror in my car that I noticed after a few hours two gems were missing out that one too. So embarrassing.

They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else.

"07 Mar, 2019",borawolf,"Seller is very responsive and offers great advice! I requested an oxidized ""black"" finish on these ear jackets, and the seller talked me through her process and gave me tips for how to polish, lighten the black, clean/care for the earrings, and more. Very impressive and kind of her! And of course the final product came out lovely with the darker finish instead of a polished silver color, they are less flashy but in a very elegant way that stands out without being obvious, so I love it. Wonderful transaction all the way, thank you so much! I chose the DHL shipping and it was lightning fast, mostly I was shocked/happy with how quickly the seller was able to create the pieces and get them to the carrier--that is service at a high level. As such I can say, buy with confidence! You will not be disappointed.",1

Only issue is that on the shop page the seller claims that the items are shipping from the U.S., however, I was charged a foreign transaction fee.

They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!",1

"25 Nov, 2015",Addy Mei,"So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too! Feels sturdy, and can be secured by positioning the climber to desired spot then squeezing both sides closed. I thought it might be too big for my small ears andI'm glad I took the risk cause it paid off. Love the fact it's adjustable! Love the packaging too (tiny test tube securely wrapped in bubble wrap) and the silver-care instructions.",0

"13 Mar, 2019",Erin,"These earrings are lovely, and great for the price! I love rose gold and these are so delicate. They shipped to me quickly and I had them in my hands a few days after ordering. Only advice is don't bend and unbend the back too much, as it's very flexible and could break off. But that shouldn't happen if you're just wearing it normally in your ear lobe.",1

I sent in an email and got an immediate response concerning my situation. She was very nice and more than happy to help. She aloud me to exchange my item for something I was not allergic to and was completely understanding. I was shocked because most shops and stores won't let you return specific jewelry even if it hadn't been used. Just make sure you read the description of what you're purchasing before you complete the transaction. That was my mistake. Overall, I would recommend to anyone!! Very happy that we have good people out there with all the chaos going on!!üòÑ",0

"27 Mar, 2018",Ina,"Sehr sch√∂ne und massive Ohrstecker. Das minimalistische Design ist toll und ich wurde schon ein paar mal auf diese Ohrringe angesprochen. Die Stecker sind gut und sauber gearbeitet, ein wenig umst√§ndlich anzuziehen (erst das Querst√ºck, dann hinter dem Ohrl√§ppchen das senkrechte Teil und dann den ""Stopfen""). Es sind keine Ohrringe, die man mal √ºber Nacht anlassen kann, da sie schon recht massiv sind. Alles in allem finde ich sie sehr sch√∂n und kann sie nur weiter empfehlen. Sie kamen in einer sehr sch√∂nen Verpackung mit einem pers√∂nlichen Gru√ü der Verk√§uferin an. Der Versand war auch okay, daf√ºr dass sie aus Griechenland kamen!",0

Will definitely be purchasing more!",1
"05 Jan, 2016",Shirley,Love the material and design of this item! I've also gotten many compliments on its unique design - it looks and feels high-quality. One thing I wasn't expecting was the thick gauge of the earring. It hurt my ear slightly and it'll take time for my ear to stretch out.,1

"19 Jun, 2020",RISA BLAIR,"Very pretty and dainty. Not overwhelmingly punk but still punk enough if you have to go to work and still want to do you. The ball post studs are shorter than all my other studs, so they do fit a bit snug, so I am using them with my other posts. They look good with everything.",1

"15 Feb, 2017",Emily,"Great product! I love these! Amy made these slightly less curved for me, since my ear is straighter and I was placing them in the 2nd whole up my ear. I had to bend them slightly to be a little straighter. They fit perfectly in the groove of my ear and stay put very well!",1
"23 Jan, 2017",Sandra Rowland,"Beautiful earrings. Her work is brilliant. Not sure what on reviewer meant that they were not packaged ready to gift. I thought it was perfect for a gift. Great customer service, quick shipping. Highly recommend shopping with her.",1
"12 Sep, 2018",A,"These earrings were in my favorites for quite some time before I finally decided to go for them (I was unsure about the length of the posts for example, but then I asked my questions online and the answer was quick and helpful). They arrived safely and I am very happy with them. The quality is very good and the posts are long enough for me to be sure I will not lose them while wearing them. I really appreciate the shape of the back piece, it is very flattering, so that despite their originality, the earrings end up being fantastically wearable with pretty much any kind of outfit. They are also very versatile as the shape becomes different with the length you chose thanks to the three wholes in the back piece. Thank you very much!",1
"04 Apr, 2019",Dorottya Bal√°zs,"I had so many expectations about my new earrings and these beautiful jackets from Vasilia have fulfilled them all! I wanted earrings, that go well with my minimalistic outfits and are simple and small enough for being worn every day and for any occasion, but I didn't want any boring ""casual studs"". These jackets have a strong character, something everyone will notice - and not because they're super shiny and large, but because they're so unique and sophisticated. Casual and yet extraordinary. Bonus for minimalists and for capsule-wardrobers: they are variable, one can wear them with or without the jackets and in many-many variations by changing the stud-part (I'll surely try them with small pearl studs). Shipping was quick, without complications and they came in a really nice little box. I definitely recommend this shop!",1
"04 May, 2020",Roos,Thanks Articats for this piece of art in my ears. I am so happy with these special earrings. It brings so much character to my daily looks. I recieved the package in my mailbox and came with a nice packaging. 10/10!,1

"07 May, 2021",Chelsey Bertram,These are dainty which is what I was looking for. I love big bold earrings but my bestie's twins will wreak havoc on my ears with them. So I had to look for baby safe earrings that were still bold. Fast shipping and the packaging was minimal but beautiful.,1

"15 Jun, 2021",Ashley N.,So at first I absolutely hated these because my earlobes are definitely too fat for them üòÇ A little tweaking later and I am in love with them! So cute and perfect for my small (but fat) ears.,1

"05 Jan, 2021",arianagabrielle91,I love them so much ! I‚Äôve owned a lot of climber style earrings. Some of the backings are really flimsy or too far apart to be able to squeeze them together to fit your ear. These ones are perfect !!!,0

I thought they would just refund the price difference. But they sent me a gold pair on the spot! I'm so grateful that they did, the gold is so so so gorgeous. Highly recommend this shop.",1

"17 Apr, 2018",catherine,"I'd be glad to review it if it were not still away across the country in Montreal, according to the tracking report. It's been stuck there a long time, so I hope somebody can get the package moving again. The package has arrived, and I'm delighted. It's especially useful to have the included little jar to keep the silver safe from tarnish. Thanks!",0
"28 Nov, 2017",trianalopez16,"I loved the packaging! The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give five stars was that the stones weren‚Äôt as brilliant as the picture depicted. After I shined the ear climbers throughly it looked a lot better. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase!",1

"17 Feb, 2019",b b,The earrings arrived fast and they look great as described. I think my ear lobes are too small for this type of ear crawler cause they don't hold it and they slip off my ear. But when on the right place they look beautiful,0
"27 May, 2020",Breanne Elko,"These are really cute! The stars are cut cleanly and they look like they do in the photos. They are comfortable to wear and easy to clean. This is the second set of earrings I've purchased (the other is a different star crawler) and the quality is consistent from this seller. They seem delicate, but they've held up quite nicely so far.",1
"12 Jun, 2018",LiSoCards,"Nice earrings, as expected. Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast. They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them. And the backings are SO SMALL!! They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears. I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these. It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine.",1

"15 Sep, 2017",Tia Edwards,"It took a bit to come in, but I absolutely love these earrings. It comes with the crescent moon/horn part being detachable, so the earrings can be worn with or without them. It's basically like having two pairs of earrings! They're also very good quality - the metal doesn't bend and it has a small notch in the metal to prevent the backs from coming off on accident. Definitely worth the money I paid for these.",1

"14 Jan, 2020",Audrie Aguilar-Martinez,"I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!",1
"11 Nov, 2017",Claudia Feraro Freeman,I had a great experience with HarshandSweet. The items I received were as expected and even better. These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased.

Beautiful quality, and amazing customer service! The only downside is the ring doesn't really look like rose gold, much more like yellow gold. But it is a gorgeous, well crafted ring regardless. Thank you!",1

"20 Aug, 2020",Hayley H,"It got shipped out WAY sooner than promised - a nice surprise! They feel very delicate, I had thought I might wear these quite often (they are very beautiful but I *think* understated enough to do so), but I am afraid of breaking them. One fits my ear better than the other but the directions were very clear and I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem (must be something with me, I imagine, as all bodies are different).

"17 Aug, 2017",Marisol Justice,"Very beautiful and high quality especially for the price, but the back part is much longer than my earlobe so they don't look as lovely on me as on the model (even using the lowest hole). I used jewelry pliers to bend the backs at an angle and it helped. If your ears are pierced on the lower side or not perfectly round you may have the same issue. But overall a beautiful item.",1

They are unique and versatile, high quality silver. The shop owner sends products in a nice box with personal touches, including cleaning cloths. I purchased a few items from her, and I love them all. I love unique jewelry, and especially sterling silver. I am happier with my pieces from Esther Chabot than from any other jewelry vendor I've purchased from on Etsy!",1
"26 Apr, 2017",AllLove,"Beautifully made. Tested and no allergic reaction. Gorgeous. Just as pictured. I love that they are adjustable so you can customize to your unique ears - so comfortable. The jacket can be adjusted in 3 ways to customize the hang length, and the locks on the studs can be adjusted in 2 ways to customize how tight they fit. Artist was very responsive and professional in all communications, including a Canada Post hiccup (Canada Post system issue, nothing to do with artist). Highly recommend this shop. Beautiful designs and high quality.",1
"03 Mar, 2016",Yvonne Frank-Tremmel,"Diese Ohrringe sind wirklich ein Hingucker, sehr sch√∂n und wertig verarbeitet.

"06 Nov, 2015",Lela Endear,"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!",1
"07 Jun, 2019",Catherine,"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. I think it looks better with one molecule and one stud asymmetrical style, but I did get a dopamine and a serotonin if I want to really make some happiness ;)",0
"15 May, 2017",Wryly Mae Eastman,"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!",1
"31 Dec, 2016",sleepyhead,I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!,0
"17 Nov, 2019",E J,"I love this product and this seller. I have bought these twice now (stupidly lost my first set... that I bought a year and a half ago) and sent many friends to buy them as well. I consistently get compliments on them. I wear them every day and they still look brand new. The earring is sturdy but soft enough that I can tighten it around my ear. Additionally this seller is so easy to work with, the seller quickly helped me with a specific request on my order, with no trouble. I have, and will, be a repeat customer.",1
"12 Feb, 2017",jessch77,"They are beautiful and delicate, can be dressed up or down. I wore them to a party last night and got tons of compliments. Would also be great for every day wear. They stayed on very well, no problems with slipping. I love them!!",1

"08 Feb, 2019",Donkey Smiles,"An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations. They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun! Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings. While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!",1

"04 Jan, 2021",Cindy,"Emma is a great artist! I placed a custom order which included the ruffled and diamond edge in many colors, they were made, shipped, and received very quickly. I was so impressed on their beauty that I ordered 2 more sets for my daughter-in-laws for Christmas. They both said the same thing, ‚ÄòGorgeous‚Äù!! Thank you Emma, you made our Christmas extra-special, all three of us are in mix-and-match heaven, lol!",1
"03 Sep, 2021",Angela Bryant,"I love the earring jackets, but they‚Äôre much bigger than I expected. The first pair I purchased were size small but they were too big. I bought another pair size x-small and they‚Äôre still too big, so I‚Äôm going to buy the xx-small! I love them all and will be able to stack them when I get the correct size for my base pair. The jackets are beautifully made and the quality is exceptional. I highly recommend Lamplighter Jewelry.",1
"01 Feb, 2018",kkdshere,These jackets are gorgeous! I got the small ones with rims and they really make your earrings stand out. I've had almost everyone in my office ask me where I got them - love them. they're not your usual frumpy old jackets but also not too much. And the packaging is a really nice touch. It's so great to open the card and untie the jackets.,0
"12 Aug, 2019",Dori,"I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!!! They are super wearable/comfortable. I work in an office answering the phone much more then I should and these don‚Äôt hurt.

"05 Jan, 2016",Judy Of the New York City Midwest,"I love love love these. I'm trying to convince myself to take them off before sleeping and I have been warned but I don't want to part with them . They are so delicate - much more so then you can tell from the picture , which doesn't do them justice. If you look at pictures of ear jackets on line you'll see some of the same designs over and over; and you'll see some real freak shows (shrunken heads?) and a few really beautiful pieces of work. These fans aren't ""everyday""- u can wear them anywhere & anyplace - but they are exceptionally beautiful. Thank you! Judy",1
"30 Oct, 2015",Jennifer Padua,"I love these earrings! I love how delicate, beautiful and versatile they are. I've gotten lots of compliments on them when wearing them. I'm happy with the price and quick shipping.",1

"01 Feb, 2021",Morgan,"My experience with this seller was amazing! I have never had a package lost in the mail before and was worried about my package since it had been a month since my order was placed. I contacted the seller concerned, and they immediately sent out another package which arrived in days. I was so happy about their patience and understanding in the situation. For the earrings, they were exactly what I expected! I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they‚Äôre beautiful. The only thing is you have to get used to putting it in your ear, especially if you‚Äôre putting it in your second hole that you rarely put earrings in. My mom prefers them in her first hole, but I think they look beautiful in a second hole with a statement earring in the first. They‚Äôre not expensive at all and they come with great quality and customer service!:)",1
"03 Feb, 2020",Amanda,"Loved these so much, I ordered my daughter a pair after I received mine. They are very dainty and feminine looking, but well made and sturdy.

"12 Mar, 2020",Madeline,These earrings are beautiful but unfortunately too large in width for my ears. One earring fell out within a couple hours of putting them on for the first time. Maybe better for those with thicker earlobes (the earring width is about 6mm).,0

"21 Sep, 2021",Claudia Bartels,"Wundersch√∂ne, filigrane Ohrstecker. Ich habe zwar Ohrstecker/-ringe erwartet, die Ohrstecker sind aber eher wie Ohr""clipse"", Ohrl√∂cher sind also nicht erforderlich. Nach der ersten √úberraschung hatte ich bef√ºrchtet, dass ich sie deswegen leicht verliere, aber ich trage sie jeden Tag und trotz Maske auf und ab, Fahrradhelm auf und ab, sind sie noch da, und ich hatte nicht einmal das Gef√ºhl, dass sie gleich abfallen. Absolut empfehlenswert!",0
"19 May, 2018",Sage,"I'd had my eye on these for a long time and I'm so glad I finally ordered. Shipped on time. Wrapped in lovely, minimal, nearly plastic-free packaging.

"18 Jul, 2017",Hannahrose Jordan,"Pros: Minimalistic. Super pretty. Everybody compliments them. I can sleep and shower and do everything with them. My hair hasn't gotten stuck in them yet. All-around superb purchase. Cons: really hard for me to put in my ears. Mostly because I think one of my holes is a little crooked. I won't be taking them out anytime soon, and it's already been a few weeks, so it doesn't matter too much.",1
"09 Aug, 2017",saraedemill,I seriously love them. I pretty much haven't taken them out since I got them and find sleeping in them to be comfortable. I did have to pull them apart a tiny bit just because they were hurting my ears but now they fit awesome. But I love them!!!!,1

"01 Nov, 2017",Jennifer D.,"SUPER nice, I wear them all day every day, I have to readjust them sometimes, they sometimes hang feom my ear and sometimes I shove them more towards the inside of my ear, wich hurts after a while, but this is how they naturally are on my ear (see pic) and I don‚Äòt even feel them. They are absolutelly beatiful. I Love Them! And should they ever break, I‚Äòll order them again from this seller! And they are sterling silver! I know because I am allergic to cheep (unreal) jewelry.

I love going to thrift stores and finding unusual jewelry, but many times the backings aren't original or well fitting. These put my heavier statement earrings back into rotation --they passed the test and had my earrings secure for the whole day. I'll probably be using them from now on with all of my earrings because I feel so safe using them. So, so happy I bought these, thank you so much!",1

The earring has stayed through scuba diving, tubing, and various other activities. It can be tricky sleeping with the earring, I‚Äôve lost the product twice now traveling in hotel rooms. Go figure, the product can stay on diving into the water but not tossing and turning at night. However I would never wear another earring! My advice take it out while sleeping.",0
"28 Aug, 2017",Katie Martin,I love this cartilage earring and style is so fun. I was looking for something a little different than the same stud I have been wearing for years.

"09 Sep, 2021",Jacqueline,"Beautiful earrings, exactly as described. Many compliments!! I ordered the gold, and it was perfect color, not too yellow colored. Easy to put on with a thin post and held nicely to my ears. Package comes with easy to follow instructions. Thank you!",1

Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to friends and family :-)",1
"06 Aug, 2021",Dani,"Super cute- will post the pic ones I take it. Only remark is that I hoped the stud to be leaf-shaped as the separate climber pieces are. It would probably be a top-notch match with nothing alike out there. However, I can understand if that is an issue in actual making of the earrings. I don‚Äôt have experience in making fashionable yet personalized & artisan items, I am just talking from the point of view of a person that enjoys them. Really beautiful earrings. Thank you for fast delivery& cute packaging.",1

"09 Nov, 2020",Lauren,"So unique!! I love wearing these when I have my hair in a ponytail as they really glam up your ears. Unfortunately, right now with Covid, wearing a mask with these is annoying as they can get caught in them and you have to adjust but eventually that wont be a problem lol",1

A bit tricky to get in the earring holes, but once they're in and adjusted, they're super comfortable! I've gotten a bunch of compliments on them. I'm excited to give my friend hers tomorrow. She's going to love them!",1
"02 Mar, 2021",Anita Campbell,"I've purchased from VermeilSupplies twice now and won't hesitate to come back. Super fast delivery and everything is high quality for a reasonable price.

"28 Apr, 2021",Hope K.,"Sweet and delicate! These are just as pictured and arrived in a timely way with minimal packaging, which is a big plus in my book. I treated myself to several ear climbers/crawlers and I wanted some new gold ones to go with some necklaces I have and these are perfect. Nice and matte and good quality fashion jewelry that looks more expensive than it is. Great price point and and I would definitely purchase from this shop again.",1
"30 May, 2019",Stacee Renee Giguere,"Originally bought this for my wedding. They ended up not the same shade of gold as my other jewelry, but are a really fun accessory. They're very cute and i get lots of compliments. Love them, thank you!",1
"23 Sep, 2017",RenataM,"These earrings are so pretty! They are slightly too big for my abnormally small ears, so the tip of the leaves sometimes digs into the top of my earlobes a bit, but they still fit and look great, and don't come off unintentionally. Bought them in bronze to match the mini ring in the same finish also from this shop-- perfect combo.",1
"14 Nov, 2017",Tamara Rose,"Beautiful set! I wish I'd purchased multiples, in different colours. I bought the gold colour which is a little off-gold, doesn't pass for real gold. But that wasn't my plan, just a heads up I'd recommend being adventurous with the colour! Arrived super fast, too!",1
"13 Feb, 2016",Anna Watkins,"Love these earrings, they look amazing and I've got loads of compliments on them. They're really comfortable to wear due to their being hypoallergenic titanium and you can adjust the tightness of the wires at the back which is useful.",1
"28 Sep, 2016",Rein Irving,"My absolute favorite everyday earrings. This is my third pair in bronze (I have a terrible habit of losing things). I will continue to buy a new pair every time I drop one down the drain or vacuum one up. I love the feel of the pins rather than posts. So many compliments. Adorable, unique, and I feel incomplete without them. Buy em. For real.",1
"27 Jan, 2018",Marta Grasso,"It's meravilleause, thin and chic. I love it!",1
"20 Jan, 2021",Abi Chapman,"So cute! I would note that the material is quite thin and bends easily, so you have to handle it with a little extra care, but it's such a lovely and unique piece.",1

"27 Dec, 2019",Marion Bell,"Bought for a Christmas present, arrived really quickly. Good quality & look great",1
"24 Sep, 2021",Janet Qiu,"Thank you again Murray, I LOVE all the earrings I‚Äôve purchased from you. This is my 2nd purchase, I bought the right side climber for my helix piercing 1st, then after seeing the amazing quality & look of this climber I‚Äôve decided to buy the left side as well but I have to wait until the lockdown ends so I can get a piercing further down, as a 3rd hole on the lobe that can hug along the curve of the ear better. The diamond cuff is also from Murray & he was very kind to offer me a special discount:) The delivery is super fast, it came only 3 days after I ordered! I bought a diamond huggie & stud to wear on my 2 lobe piercings to complete the look but it‚Äôs from India & it‚Äôs taken almost a month & I‚Äôm still waiting. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy, other stores selling much similar climber with smaller diamonds sell for way more!",1
"22 Aug, 2021",kdash8106,Totally in love with these! I've purchased many items from Murray over the past year and a half and I think these earrings might just be my new favorite! I bought a pair (left & right) in yellow gold and attached a pic (taken at night). The diamonds have fantastic sparkle and are the perfect size. Thank you Murray for another amazing item!,1

"13 Dec, 2018",staceysullivanstanle,I purchased the gold-plated marquise ear crawlers. They are gorgeous! Very high quality craftsmanship! I received them sooner than expected and in perfect condition. I have been wearing them all day and they are super comfortable (I forgot that I had them on) and attractive. Thank you so much!!,1
"13 Jan, 2020",Jane,The earrings are so beautiful! I got them for my sister and she simply loved them! They came right on time and it was such an easy process when ordering. It was really sweet too because they even emailed me to ask if the time of arrival was ok since it was after Christmas. So a sweet and kind. Truly love ordering from Etsy! Definitely. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!,1

"02 Nov, 2019",Sara Ellingsworth,"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!",1
"20 Sep, 2021",Lyudmila Skidelsky,Rebekah was so quick to respond to all of my questions and the order was received in less than a week. I purchased the stud and climber combo in rose gold. Honestly it‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. Just the way it glistens. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!,0
"18 Nov, 2020",Ryan St. Clair,Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I‚Äôm very happy with this piece!,1
"20 Feb, 2020",sonyakalim,Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).,1
"30 Nov, 2016",NeedlequeenKelly,Wow. Just wow. These earrings look beautiful and are fantastic quality and design. I'm so thrilled with them. I am sure I will be ordering from you again! Thank you! I also received the matching moon bracelet as a Christmas present and it is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is superb. Thank you so much Kathy!,1

I know that these pretty, minimalist climbers are going to be a staple in my wardrobe.",1

"10 May, 2018",eunseonghwang,"The earrings are delicate and beautiful and I'm very happy with my purchase. Benitta got back to me in a timely manner with any questions I had, and overall, I'm very happy with my order. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because the of the packaging. The gift box it came in had a blob of whiteout on the inside of the lid, and the box was a bit dusty with marks on the inside as well. It looked rather cheap compared to the actual product itself (the earrings are gorgeous!) so I was a bit underwhelmed. But what I ordered is more important than the packaging it came in, and the earrings look just like the picture, so overall I'm really happy with my purchase.",1

"18 Jul, 2018",Ariana Bronson,"Absolutely gorgeous, dainty, and classy! These climbers are very lightweight and stay in place with the backings. FYI, they are not interchangeable from left to right ear, so you have to make sure they are in right! I'd say the only downside to these is that you can't sleep in them. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! Thanks.",1
"05 Feb, 2021",Nina,They are beautiful in person! Just what I was looking for a dainty ear climber. I love them,1

"19 Feb, 2020",Edith Yung,"A great little chain to add an accent piercing to my ear! Super light weight and has not tarnished. I‚Äôve worn this pretty much everyday and into the shower as well and it still looks as delicate as when I first got it! I have the length 25mm here and I have very small ears. I would definitely recommend getting 30 mm if you‚Äôre thinking of using this for a conch piercing or a helix piercing so that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äústrangle‚Äù or cut into your ear. Definitely my own fault that I didn‚Äôt get a longer chain, but it still looks very cute with the current placement I think!",1

"23 Feb, 2021",AmAmstarshyn,I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.,1

"25 Sep, 2020",avargas1537,This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!,1

"21 Sep, 2020",Elizabeth Thacker,So beautiful. Simple but make a statement of beauty. The price is perfect. It did take a while to get to me with the covid and the fact they had to be shipped to the U.S. from Israel. But for sure worth the wait for such reasonably priced earrings!,1

"12 May, 2018",Nico Stellar,I am very happy with the quality and simplicity of my earrings. The seller is very friendly.

"31 Dec, 2016",sleepyhead,I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!,0
"19 Sep, 2014",jeanshi,Beautiful. The shipping takes awhile - about a month for me - but totally worth the wait. These pins are excellent quality.,1

"15 Sep, 2019",Andrea C.,"Very, very pretty and worth the wait (6 weeks from order to delivery to Florida). Wish it came in 20 gauge because 18 gauge was hard to insert in my earlobes. I do understand that 18g makes for a sturdier piece. Nice!",1

"23 Feb, 2021",AmAmstarshyn,I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.,1

"08 Aug, 2015",nimloth87,"Thank you for my new favourite earrings! I've been wearing them every day since I got them. I was worried at first they wouldn't fit my ear but they're actually perfect. The temptation to just sleep with them is very strong, I must admit. The little bottle they come with is really cute and is one of the many reasons these earrings would be perfect as a present. The shipping was a lot faster than I expected, too. So, I'm very happy on all fronts and I will definitely buy again from your shop. :D",1

However, the item took a lot of time to arrive and the tracking wasn't updated, seller was hard to reach as well. Very cute packaging. If it weren't for the slow shipping and the difficulty to reach the seller, this would've gotten five stars.",1
"05 May, 2015",Katy Sunshine,Love them!!

"23 Feb, 2021",AmAmstarshyn,I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.,1

"03 Mar, 2019",Margaret Tinsley,"These earrings are so cute, but they didn't work for me. The black coating was coming off within a couple weeks, and once the interior was exposed I had a reaction in one ear. That earring was a different color -shiny brownish- under the black coating, but not all the way to the core. I worked with the seller to try to figure out what it might be, but we didn't come to a definitive answer. Still, she was very kind, helpful, and offered a refund. Great customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this shop again, although I might stick to solid metal rather than plated options.",0

Always a really nice touch, would definitely buy from this shop again!",1
"10 Jan, 2017",Sara Rivadeneyra,I'm obsessed with the earrings but they shipping from so far away that it took me a month and a half to get them. Be aware of the shipping time but other than that I love the product.,1
"28 Aug, 2018",Keren Kroll,"I took my time writing this review to thoroughly test these earrings. I admit I was disappointed these had the looped pin style attachment as I have not had success with those in the past. They are always too loose or not secure enough and the weight of the earring will cause it to continuously fall throughout the day. These earrings, however, are designed flawlessly where the pin back is curved and follows the contours of your ear and stays perfectly in place. They are both comfortable and fully functional, where you dont have to pinch the metal to your ears to get them to stay up. Also the stones are gorgeous and have a lovely clarity and luxurious, high quality shape. Overall, I absolutely recommend these and I am going to check out more of their jewelry as I am very impressed.",0

Unfortunately the replacement pair wasn't much better. They're still cute for the price, but the quality isn't great.

Looks almost like I have multiple piercings. It was a little tricky putting them on the first time, but easier with practice. I also loved that the earrings came packaged in a cute little corked glass bottle for storing them in so they won't tarnish easily. Seller responded quickly to my questions, and the shipment got here pretty quickly considering they came from the Philippines. I will buy from this artist again.",1
"06 May, 2020",Trinidad,"I love these, they look so beautiful and they fit nicely! It took a bit for me to get them on since my piercing is a bit wonky - but that is just a me thing.

Beatriz was very nice; she told if they didn't arrive by the expected day she would've contacted the delivering company to see where it was. Definitely going to be buying more from them! The wait was worth it. I live in New York. It took a little bit over a month to get here.,0

"05 Jan, 2016",Shirley,Love the material and design of this item! I've also gotten many compliments on its unique design - it looks and feels high-quality. One thing I wasn't expecting was the thick gauge of the earring. It hurt my ear slightly and it'll take time for my ear to stretch out.,1

"20 May, 2019",Brenda,"These earrings are pretty perfect. Sort of funky, sort of simple, sort of elegant, sort of bad-ass - and VERY unique! I really like to wear these a LOT! Usually I do so along with some edgier earrings - chains or crystals, etc. But even along with earrings like the ones pictured - where I would have never thought they would ""go"" - they look pretty fab. I liked them so much - I ordered a few more pairs. They fit really well too! Not like the easily found cheap cheesy ones where the hanging jacket piece falls way below your ear and just looks odd. MomoSara's almost look like the hanging jacket ball is levitating - or that you are wearing a barbell type earring! Pretty AWESOME!",1
"16 Apr, 2018",earlybirdwing,"I love these cute earrings so much! I get a lot of compliments on them and I love having one of a kind jewelry like this.

"03 Apr, 2021",Jenni Tarner,"Cutest shop ever! They sent my products in this item bitty teeny ring box and sent an Easter candy along with it. Shipping was incredibly fast, was super suprised to see it in the mailbox already. This particular product is super amazing, the 6mm was the perfect size for my daith piercing (although it WAS a pain to screw the ball on because it was so short to my ear, but that's not the products fault, it's just because I prefer it to be very snug and short in my ear). The fire opal is super cute, very colorful. I got all white opal so all my earrings were cohesive and matching and this particular opal is very pretty! 10/10 would reccomend. Also, quality was awesome, I know some people could be skeptical buying online but this was great and all pieces soaked wonderfully in rubbing alcohol",1

Just a bit longer and then they can be shown off! I feel fierce, Art Deco-esque vibes just looking at them. I love that these are lightweight earrings. They won't contribute to sagging earlobes later. The design is unique. Nina is very friendly, professional and helpful.",1

"27 Aug, 2021",CallacoCorner,"Style is fabulous and so unique! Bought it assuming it was metal, so when I discovered it was acrylic I did feel the price was a bit high. But overall I am very happy with the look and the fact that the materials are hypoallergenic.",1

"31 Aug, 2021",Marcela,"The earrings look exactly as in the pictures. At first I was a little bit skeptical because the images look kind of digital enhanced but the earrings are really smooth and shiny like that. They look and feel of very good quality, they‚Äôre sturdy and they have a nice dazzling golden look. It‚Äôs the first ear crawlers I buy and I just realized that my ears might be too small for this size of earring, so next time I‚Äôll buy smaller ones. I‚Äôll use them, because they look so good anyways!",1
"04 May, 2017",Nicole,"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot.",1

This is my 2nd purchase, I bought the right side climber for my helix piercing 1st, then after seeing the amazing quality & look of this climber I‚Äôve decided to buy the left side as well but I have to wait until the lockdown ends so I can get a piercing further down, as a 3rd hole on the lobe that can hug along the curve of the ear better. The diamond cuff is also from Murray & he was very kind to offer me a special discount:) The delivery is super fast, it came only 3 days after I ordered! I bought a diamond huggie & stud to wear on my 2 lobe piercings to complete the look but it‚Äôs from India & it‚Äôs taken almost a month & I‚Äôm still waiting. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy, other stores selling much similar climber with smaller diamonds sell for way more!",1

"27 Aug, 2019",laurinda Castro,"Very cool design but the metal is really thin, which makes them feel kinda cheap, for the price. The thin metal makes the sliver moon on the top and bottom of the moon phase design razor sharp. My husband will be filing them down for me before I wear them especially because I have a newborn and i could fully see him slicing his hands or face on the edges of these earrings. If the edges were sanded before distribution, I would have given these a better review.",0

They are so delicate - much more so then you can tell from the picture , which doesn't do them justice. If you look at pictures of ear jackets on line you'll see some of the same designs over and over; and you'll see some real freak shows (shrunken heads?) and a few really beautiful pieces of work. These fans aren't ""everyday""- u can wear them anywhere & anyplace - but they are exceptionally beautiful. Thank you! Judy",1

"18 Jul, 2018",Ariana Bronson,"Absolutely gorgeous, dainty, and classy! These climbers are very lightweight and stay in place with the backings. FYI, they are not interchangeable from left to right ear, so you have to make sure they are in right! I'd say the only downside to these is that you can't sleep in them. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! Thanks.",1

The ear that I can use my dominant hand for always looks great, and the other ear is a struggle to get on correctly and have it stay. The back part of this climber is also a bit longer than the other one - not sure if that has an effect. I'm hoping my husband's help will make that go smoother!",1

"02 Nov, 2019",Sara Ellingsworth,"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!",1
"20 Sep, 2021",Lyudmila Skidelsky,Rebekah was so quick to respond to all of my questions and the order was received in less than a week. I purchased the stud and climber combo in rose gold. Honestly it‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. Just the way it glistens. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!,0

"20 Feb, 2020",sonyakalim,Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).,1
"25 Jan, 2019",samkusumo,OMG! I used it for NYE party and I got sooooo many compliments for these statement earrings. They look amazing! Thankfully it arrived earlier than I expected and I'm so glad that I was able to wear it. Looks amazing with my dress. Just wow!,1

"14 May, 2020",Joyce Chan,"Loved the concept of this earring, I consider it a small work of art. It wasn't quite as expected: I didn't anticipate being able to see my piercing hole and the curve that wraps around the ear is more squared off than in the picture, but still cool.",0

"23 Feb, 2021",AmAmstarshyn,I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.,1

They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else.

I understand they are hand made, and they are pretty. With taxes and shipping they were just shy of $60.00 for a small pair of earrings, I don't believe I will be a repeat customer.",0

The quality of the earrings is great! I was worried when I purchased these that my ear lobes would be too big for the back piece to properly fit (I‚Äôve got large lobes) but they have 3 different settings that allow for the perfect fit. Overall great shopping experience and highly recommend this shop to others! :),1

"12 Jul, 2019",desireehawk,I have tried for years to find an ear cuff I liked well enough to wear. Comfort was also a huge issue. I am a tall woman so I wear my jewelry.... it doesn‚Äôt wear me.... but some ear cuffs are more torture devices than jewelry. This lovely cuff sits comfortably on the ear & is easily forgotten until you glance in a mirror. It is magic! I am delighted! Think I have purchased somewhere around 15 pieces from your gallery of wonderful jewelry delights. I love them all! The Dragon Trio is my favorite! Keep creating‚ù§Ô∏è,1

"06 Nov, 2015",Lela Endear,"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique.

"31 Dec, 2016",sleepyhead,I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!,0
"05 Jun, 2019",Meghan Hayes,"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!",1

"25 Apr, 2018",Raechelle Masuda,I absolutely love these earrings. Seriously I get compliments a few times a week on the triangle ones. I love an active lifestyle and these are perfect to give me an edge look and style. I initially wanted the stick ones and bought the triangles on a whim. I haven‚Äôt taken them off!

"06 Oct, 2019",Mindy,"Love these earrings so much! It's like 2 pairs in one. If you just want to wear the studs, fine. If you want to add the larger, hollow triangles, excellent! I've found that I can even wear the larger ones in two different locations too (thread the stud post through the tiny hole OR through the triangle itself). Aaaand sometimes I even add the hollow triangles to totally different studs. So love the mix n' match capabilities!",1
"31 Oct, 2020",Rosann,"These earrings are awesome! They can be worn 2 different ways, either 1 side on top of the earlobe and the other side behind the earlobe or both pieces together on the front of the earlobe. They are delicate and elegant!

"02 Nov, 2019",Sara Ellingsworth,"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!",1
"20 Sep, 2021",Lyudmila Skidelsky,Rebekah was so quick to respond to all of my questions and the order was received in less than a week. I purchased the stud and climber combo in rose gold. Honestly it‚Äôs even more beautiful in person. Just the way it glistens. I can‚Äôt wait to wear them!,0

"09 Jan, 2018",LL,"I orders two earrings and here is the picture for ones with dragonfly. The mono phrases- They are just damn great! It looks like Ara has worked on customer issues as the handles on my earrings seem superb (does not seem at all like they are going to come off as I read in some previous reviews). One seems to be a bit tight and hurts the ear if is kept too long, but I will just adjust the handle carefully, it should do the trick. In general they are a bit different from what I imagined and I am very hard to please client and do not leave 5 stars in general, but this item is really good and has the subtle ornamented silver that gives other qualities. Comes with a cute bottle that I was happy to receive even if the earrings did not fit so Ara added extra packaging. And a nice polishing cloth too. Thank you and good luck!",1

"25 Nov, 2015",Addy Mei,"So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too!

The CZ stones are well cut and they're all consistent, so they offer maximum sparkle. There's a pin for the earlobe piercing, and an adjustable clip for the upper ear. Very stable UNLESS you touch your ear a lot (eg I answer lots of phone calls at work). I have hundreds of pieces in my jewelry collection, but I receive more compliments on these earrings than I do on almost anything else I wear. Would absolutely recommend and repurchase!",1

"13 May, 2020",Meagan,"These are my second pair of earrings from SamiJewels, and I have been impressed with both sets I have. I have been getting more into ‚Äúear climbers‚Äù as the backs stay closer to my ear than traditional stud earring backs, making them more comfortable for me. The curve of the back of these makes this pair even more comfortable. The stones are so shiny, and catch the light beautifully. I chose the rose gold, which I have been very happy with as it is a little different and feels slightly more feminine than gold or silver. The quality paired with the price of these earrings have earned SamiJewels a return customer.",1
"22 Mar, 2021",M,Love them! I have sensitive ears and these have caused zero flare ups so far. Plus they're just the right amount of sparkle for everyday wear - so adorable. üíï,1

"08 Jun, 2021",Amanda Hedge,"These are beautiful and seemingly high quality! Real moonstone, which is awesome, no fake opalite. I have them in my second lobes, so that section of my ear is a little bit thinner and the earring tends to slip. All I have to do is give it a little squeeze and it stays up nicely. I don't want to take them off now!",1
"02 Feb, 2021",Melissa Sanchez,"I love these earrings, they were a little weirdly big so I had to adjust the back a bit so they wouldn't fall off but other than that they look beautiful even though I don't have the best wire bending skills.",1

"13 Mar, 2018",laurebernardet,"Really pretty and quickly sent. I would definitely recommend this and buy some more from this shop ! I would have preferred the ""jacket"" to be attached to the rear part of the earing though, to make it more convenient and control its orientation (right now it has to be against your neck).",1

The earrings are lightweight & what caught my attention, even more, is that Kellan & Kiera took time to handwrite a thank you card to their consumers! It was a personal & thoughtful touch.

"24 Sep, 2020",Lisa Stuhr,"I really love these earrings. The posts are thin which makes it easy to put them on. Sometimes they fall vertically, but I think I just have to figure out how to adjust the earring backing and post so they stay put. These are the perfect size and color. They are minimal and elegant. Delivery was so fast, too. Jut as beautiful as the photos. Exceptional experience.",1

"06 Nov, 2015",Lela Endear,"Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day. Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!",1
"07 Jun, 2019",Catherine,"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. I think it looks better with one molecule and one stud asymmetrical style, but I did get a dopamine and a serotonin if I want to really make some happiness ;)",0
"15 May, 2017",Wryly Mae Eastman,"Totally my favorite earrings. Such s great idea and they look just wonderful. Good quality and everyone always asks about them and compliments them. Finding this product has totally gotten me into looking and purchasing more science inspired jewelry, I love it!",1
"31 Dec, 2016",sleepyhead,I'm a return customer and have previously purchased two ear climbers. I was keen to get a a few more designs as I loved the cut of the April birthstone (even though my birthday isn't in April :P) and I wanted the Big Dipper and Dopamine as they were more simple yet still eye catching. They're all beautiful. The only thing is these feel much thinner than the previous ear climbers I own. It makes it easier to put on but doesn't feel as sturdy as my old ones. This time round shipping took a much longer time to arrive. I was having issues with the tracking ID as it didn't update and I had no idea where the item was. I had to call the post office and there had been no scans done on the couriers end. I only found out it was in the country when the post man attempted delivery. So after almost 6 weeks after being shipped I got them!,0
"22 Nov, 2020",Jacqueline Hanson,From beginning to end this was a wonderful shopping experience. I had questions regarding how I should order and if it‚Äôs one size fits all. I was explained everything! I submitted a picture of my ear as well to help with fit for the curvature of my ear and she created it from there. Needless to say it‚Äôs perfect!!!,1
"13 Aug, 2020",stacey nicholson,Even better than I imagined. A custom piece as wanted it shorter. Communicated with ease and I love the end product! Can not fault and I will be purchasing from seller again,1
"09 Nov, 2018",Sheree Watt,"I really admire the craftsmanship and the style. I would have given 5* for customer service and honouring my request to have it smoothed out. Only I didn't know that I had to adjust them a little to fit my lobe (would have been useful advice). Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers. Other than that, if you like simple unique chic pieces that speaks volumes, get it touch with this seller. It may be just what your heart desires.",1
"17 Jul, 2018",Lunartas,Absolutely love this! I've been wanting one for ages and this is exactly what I was after :),1
"18 Apr, 2017",linswt16,"Just received my wave cartilage earring and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Exactly like the picture! It's so dainty and comfortable!

"12 Aug, 2020",Brandy Curry,I absolutely love this earring! And I love how I don‚Äôt have to try and screw in a ball to the back! So easy to put in! Can‚Äôt wait to buy more jewelry from this show!!,1
"18 Dec, 2018",Morgan Long,"This is the only cartilage earring I have worn for years! I get compliments on the item daily. I have been purchasing from this buyer for 5yrs now. The earring has stayed through scuba diving, tubing, and various other activities. It can be tricky sleeping with the earring, I‚Äôve lost the product twice now traveling in hotel rooms. Go figure, the product can stay on diving into the water but not tossing and turning at night. However I would never wear another earring! My advice take it out while sleeping.",0
"28 Aug, 2017",Katie Martin,I love this cartilage earring and style is so fun. I was looking for something a little different than the same stud I have been wearing for years. It doesn't fit me as well as I had hoped but I think that has more to do with the location of my piercing than the design. It is very comfortable!,1

The only thing is that the ear jacket hangs down a little too low below my ear, but that's to be expected, as not everyone's earlobe is the same size. It's really cute and I would (and did) purchase from this shop again",1
"07 Nov, 2020",Victoria Tycholis,This is exactly what I wanted and came as pictured. This is my first ear jacket set and I love how it fits nicely in my noise-cancelling headphones (very important to me).,1

"05 Jul, 2017",Danielle Philibotte,"These are SO cute and unlike anything else I have. I actually love the studs so much that I keep them in and am going to order a second pair to wear in my second piercing. They are comfortable enough to sleep in (and I do). I'm reserving the jackets for when I wear my hair up in a ponytail or braid but have tried them on and absolutely adore them!! I'm very sensitive to some metals and my piercings get infected if the metal is cheap, these don't bother my skin at all. Shipping was fast too! I LOVE them!!",1
"02 Feb, 2021",melowdrama,I waited a long time to buy these and am very happy I finally pulled the trigger. The earrings are so pretty and unique. I paired the jackets from these with some good posts I own and they look just as fabulous.,1
"24 Oct, 2016",llfrenchie,"I took a bit of a gamble with these as I paid for shipping to the UK and also, I didn't even know what the returns policy was with earrings! I'm really glad I did though, they arrived pretty quickly and they're just so different: simple but edgy-looking, I haven't seen anything like them before.

"03 Aug, 2020",CatLin,I just recently discovered ear crawlers and I'm a little obsessed. These are perfect. One of my favorite earrings to wear now.,1
"10 Aug, 2020",Jessica Lewis,"Overall, these earrings are great! They fit snuggly, came fast, and I have gotten several compliments. My only ""complaint"" is the little L shaped hook part, to get them from falling off your ears, is bent at a different spot on each earring. It's not a huge deal, and once they are on, I can't tell, but it just seemed odd that they wouldn't be perfectly the same at the start. I didn't take off a star for this, as it may have been a one-off. But great price and I'm really happy with them! I will probably buy more.",1

I wore these earrings right away at the airport and got complements from a custom agent. I was happy to tell him they came from Greece! Now onto the earrings, they are extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. At first I thought they were too long but then I got used to them. They can also be worn vertically if desired instead of as an ear crawler. I thought I would have to add an earring back but once they are in the hole and secure against your ear lobe they do not move or come off. I even swim with them on and had no problem, and slept with them too and they are so snug you don't notice they are there. To prevent moving around, press in the sterling silver bar tightly to secure. Love these!",0

Only I didn't know that I had to adjust them a little to fit my lobe (would have been useful advice). Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers. Other than that, if you like simple unique chic pieces that speaks volumes, get it touch with this seller. It may be just what your heart desires.",1

"06 Dec, 2020",Erin Vasta,"Fantastic earrings!! I keep getting compliments on them and they're so comfortable to wear, even with the added hurdle of a mask! The only negative for me would be that they are a bit bigger than I expected so it's hard to wear them both in one ear. This is more to do with my piercings being a bit too close together and less to do with the earrings, but keep that in mind if you have piercings close together like me. That said, I wear them one in each ear and it looks amazing! I particularly like the subtle difference of having a chain on one but not the other. Definitely recommend!",1

Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers.

"31 Aug, 2021",Marcela,"The earrings look exactly as in the pictures. At first I was a little bit skeptical because the images look kind of digital enhanced but the earrings are really smooth and shiny like that. They look and feel of very good quality, they‚Äôre sturdy and they have a nice dazzling golden look. It‚Äôs the first ear crawlers I buy and I just realized that my ears might be too small for this size of earring, so next time I‚Äôll buy smaller ones. I‚Äôll use them, because they look so good anyways!",1

"09 Nov, 2018",Sheree Watt,"I really admire the craftsmanship and the style. I would have given 5* for customer service and honouring my request to have it smoothed out. Only I didn't know that I had to adjust them a little to fit my lobe (would have been useful advice). Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers. Other than that, if you like simple unique chic pieces that speaks volumes, get it touch with this seller. It may be just what your heart desires.",1

"22 Nov, 2020",Jacqueline Hanson,From beginning to end this was a wonderful shopping experience. I had questions regarding how I should order and if it‚Äôs one size fits all. I was explained everything! I submitted a picture of my ear as well to help with fit for the curvature of my ear and she created it from there. Needless to say it‚Äôs perfect!!!,1
"13 Aug, 2020",stacey nicholson,Even better than I imagined. A custom piece as wanted it shorter. Communicated with ease and I love the end product! Can not fault and I will be purchasing from seller again,1
"09 Nov, 2018",Sheree Watt,"I really admire the craftsmanship and the style. I would have given 5* for customer service and honouring my request to have it smoothed out. Only I didn't know that I had to adjust them a little to fit my lobe (would have been useful advice). Really excited out the box and wore them out without a second thought, only to find them hanging like down like costume jewellery from a sci-fi movie--which is not the look I was going for. Lesson learnt...take the time to adjust to your earlobe for a snug fit unless you like idea of them slowly transforming into low hangers. Other than that, if you like simple unique chic pieces that speaks volumes, get it touch with this seller. It may be just what your heart desires.",1

Such a remarkable job done on the crafting, in so thankful to have come across your shop. Thank you so much, she also loved the wish bracelet as well. <3 Look forward to purchasing from you again.",1
"05 Aug, 2019",Carolym,"I had seen ear climbers on other ears and wondered how they were anchored if by studs or long wires, I am intrigued but am concerned if the wire hook at the bottom rubs against the back of your ear? I have not tried them on yet but wanted to hear your reply first. I love them; they are beautiful and look well made. Shipping was faster than I expected. Thank you for the extra gift of a wish bracelet and know what my wish/prayer will be!",1

"05 Mar, 2021",Jadelyn Trinkle,"This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve ordered from Harley‚Äôs Jewelry and it won‚Äôt be the last. Stunning craftsmanship, and quick turnaround. I really can‚Äôt say enough nice things about the jewelry I‚Äôve purchased from this artisan. In all honesty, this particular piece is higher quality than the Billie Valentine original it‚Äôs based off of. The clip that stabilizes the back half against your ear has a stronger hinge and the rubber backing keeps it in place compared with the original that slips. So, if you have a choice between BV and this one, buy this one. I‚Äôll update my review with a photo later on, but you don‚Äôt need it to trust you‚Äôre doing business with the best.",1
"05 Aug, 2020",Caitlin Burns,Here I am to post another amazing review! Same photo as the last one because I cant wear the earring for 6 weeks (I really wish I got my ears done last year). Overall the earring is so cute and cant wait to show it off in the future!,1

Though I would love if it had one extra height hole in the back of the moon part (there are two in order to adjust the height of the moon relative to the bottom of your ear).

They have a locking mechanism that keeps the backs from being lost. That is important because I have lost so many backs from putting on and taking off my face masks. I love the little soft pouch they can be kept in also. I noticed the engraved part of the signs have sparkles in them. This, I think, adds to their appearance and glamour.

"05 Aug, 2021",Lynlee,"I‚Äôm new to the ‚Äúear climber‚Äù type of jewelry, and when saw these I was so excited to get them. However, when I saw they would be shipping from Greece to me, in California, I thought twice about it and initially decided against it. But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it and I took a chance and ordered from Artikats anyway! And OH MY GOSH, I‚Äôm sooo glad I did! First off, the craftsmanship is exquisite. These pieces (I bought two different types) are just beautiful. The artist is highly skilled at her craft! Secondly, the fit is perfect; they‚Äôre dainty and look so beautiful on the ear. But the most impressive part is that I received the package within a week of ordering, FROM GREECE TO THE US‚Ä¶with an expected date much further off. So, ORDER from Artikats, I‚Äôm so grateful I did! I HIGHLY recommend this shop! Thank you Artikats!",1

"31 Jul, 2018",pantoneblack,"I was surprised when these arrived and are basically bent wire. The circles in front and back are open and not soldered closed, so they don't make a full loop and there's a gap/opening in the wire that makes them look really cheap. Also, the two earrings were very different in shape/size. The shipping took a long time (though there was also a holiday within the stated ship time). The plus side to the delayed shipping is that I was able to amend my order, to which Griffin was very helpful.",0

"01 Jul, 2019",Jasmin Huang,"Absolutely beautiful earring! Definitely came much quicker than the 2-3 weeks that it originally stated in the listing. I needed as a helix earring to replace a broken one I had been wearing, saw this earclimber and absolutely fell in love with the design. I wanted the earring to climb ""down"" instead of up, so I though it would be good to purchase the opposing ear (left earring for right ear). I messaged Evelyn and she was kind enough to give me many angles of the earring including measurements to make sure I felt like I was making the right decision. I definitely think I did! The earring came in a beautiful box with a nice gift bag and polishing cloth if you want to gift it.",1
"15 Oct, 2019",Taylor Boykins,"I bought a pair of these, loved them so much the posts broke!!! In like, 2 days. BUT Evelyn was so generous, asked that I send them back so she can see, and she made a brand-new pair free-of-charge. Each time, she included a handwritten note which made it so personal. I felt like I was just buying lovely stuff from a friend! DO buy these earrings, they're so delicate and beautiful. Just a friendly tip, though, be sure not to bend the hooks too far out so the earrings will last a little longer. I was not so graceful the first time around but will be going forward. THANK YOU, EVELYN!!",1
"13 Jun, 2019",quornhed,"Dispatched quickly and arrived earlier than expected. This is truly a beautiful earring, very unusual and sits perfectly in the ear. Very comfortable to wear and the detail is gorgeous. If you are ordering from the UK be aware that you will have to pay customs charges and that will delay receipt of the item. Royal mail charge an ¬£8 handling fee so in total add an extra ¬£16.69 to your purchase cost. That being said it is still very worth it for this stunning ear crawler. Very happy with this wonderful earring.",1

I‚Äôve ordered cheaper jewelry from other shops before, and you definitely get what you pay for. I‚Äôm used to the jewelry looking better in the pictures, but not with this shop! I was shocked at just how beautiful everything was. And they are so nice, I didn‚Äôt know whether to get the 6mm or 8mm length labret for a conch piercing, and I went with the 6mm and left a note saying if they think the 8mm back would be better, to just send it instead, but they went ahead and sent both lengths!! Which I‚Äôm so thankful for since the 8mm ended up being the more comfortable size. I‚Äôll never order from another shop!! Customer for life.",1

I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven‚Äôt taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in.

"18 May, 2021",Annette Colando,"I am very satisfied with this large 14KT gold diamond climber earring. I chose to buy two to wear as a pair of earrings and they look very nice on the ears. I felt the color of the gold was very nice, not that tarnish dull look, had some slight heft of weight that you could initially feel in your hand when you first picked one or both up. The diamonds aren‚Äôt huge, dull, or yellowish cloudy and they are not chips, which I did not totally expect, but they definitely have to pass that ‚Äúquality‚Äù and ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù factor for me to keep my purchase, which I am very happy to say, and recommend this seller to anyone for being highly recommended first before spending and going to your brick and mortar stores when in reality these pieces are as well just as beautiful but by giving you a by far better value.",0

This is my 2nd purchase, I bought the right side climber for my helix piercing 1st, then after seeing the amazing quality & look of this climber I‚Äôve decided to buy the left side as well but I have to wait until the lockdown ends so I can get a piercing further down, as a 3rd hole on the lobe that can hug along the curve of the ear better. The diamond cuff is also from Murray & he was very kind to offer me a special discount:) The delivery is super fast, it came only 3 days after I ordered! I bought a diamond huggie & stud to wear on my 2 lobe piercings to complete the look but it‚Äôs from India & it‚Äôs taken almost a month & I‚Äôm still waiting. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy, other stores selling much similar climber with smaller diamonds sell for way more!",1

Thank you again Zozi - I can highly recommend buying your art! :)",1

Weswegen man darauf vertrauen muss, dass es echtes Silber ist. Nur deswegen gebe ich 4 Sterne (weil ich dahingehend schon schlechte Erfahrungen hatte..jedoch nichtig Etsy).Nat√ºrlich musste auch Zoll dazu bezahlt werden. Sonst g√§be es 5",0

I am so happy with how they fit me, meaning the snowflakes hang down low enough to be seen and are not hidden behind my ear. I appreciate the high quality of the earrings, and the little soft bag they come in just adds a touch of elegance. The earrings also come with an extra pair of backs if you want to just wear the snowman without the snowflake jacket. I cannot say enough good things about this seller.

"18 May, 2021",Annette Colando,"I am very satisfied with this large 14KT gold diamond climber earring. I chose to buy two to wear as a pair of earrings and they look very nice on the ears. I felt the color of the gold was very nice, not that tarnish dull look, had some slight heft of weight that you could initially feel in your hand when you first picked one or both up. The diamonds aren‚Äôt huge, dull, or yellowish cloudy and they are not chips, which I did not totally expect, but they definitely have to pass that ‚Äúquality‚Äù and ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù factor for me to keep my purchase, which I am very happy to say, and recommend this seller to anyone for being highly recommended first before spending and going to your brick and mortar stores when in reality these pieces are as well just as beautiful but by giving you a by far better value.",0

I have had them six + months and they have come out accidentally maybe three times (all of which were my fault), which is saying a lot because I have super thick hair and they NEVER get caught in it and pull out. They are super simple and stylish and go with so much. I have received a ton of compliments on them and even bought them as presents for my friends. I love them that much! If you need some earrings to put in, know they will look good, and never worry about them GET THESE!",1
"27 Nov, 2017",yllndnd,"Absolutely perfect. Wanted something fun but comfortable to sleep in for an upper cartilage piercing and this works perfectly. It is amazingly comfortable (although a little trickier to get in and twist through the cartilage piercing than the regular piercing - I tried both). It stays put and I love how it reflects the light. It‚Äôs fun, but still understated enough that I feel comfortable leaving it in when I go to the office. It arrived right on schedule and was packaged with care. Would definitely recommend to anyone else considering purchasing. I got the 14K solid gold because I have metal allergies and I‚Äôve had no problems.",1

If you like big, bulk earrings you'll love these because as I say, they are beautiful. They just weren't quite what I was looking for.",1

"27 Aug, 2021",Anna Matrice,"Such a beautiful climber!! It took around three weeks to arrive in Germany and was well worth the wait! As you can see in the picture, my ear lobe is relatively small while the antihelix seems huge. While most other nice climbers I found are just too big for my lobule, the form of this climber fits perfectly (just) :-) Funny story when picking it from the post station: I couldn't wait until I got home, so I unpacked it and threw the packaging into a huge bin. Only to discover that the sachet was empty, despite the business card (it had a hole). So I had to lean far into the bin to catch the packaging with the climber. Even this was well worth it!! Thanks much for creating this beautiful item :-)",0

"04 Jun, 2020",theweetexaslassie,The metal is good quality and the packaging is beautiful. The back of the earrings are two butterfly backings side by side.

So now I wear them with borrowed better backs from another set of earrings. The lashes part is so cool, and I got complemented yesterday on the earrings. Also the shipping was pretty quick.

"30 Nov, 2020",cosbyh,"Loved these! They are just as beautiful and sparkly in person. Wore them for my wedding day and plan to wear them for many more weddings/events I attend. The only issue was the size of the holes in the ear jacket itself. The earring posts only fit in some (not all) of the holes, so I couldn't wear them on the lower setting I wanted to (since only one side fit through). I wore them on a higher setting so the ear jacket sat lower. They still looked great, just not quite the look I was going for.",0
"12 May, 2018",Catherine Kohl,My wedding jewelry is so perfect! These earrings sparkle like you wouldn‚Äôt believe! The seller was so nice to email me back and forth about the color of the gold.

"17 Dec, 2019",Mandy Farmer,I ADORE this earrings! They looked so beautiful on my wedding day! I received so many compliments on them too! Amazing quality - so happy I went with EldorTinaJewelry!,1
"28 Aug, 2019",Golddlox,Absolutely stunning! I was able to work with her to get specific colors to go with my dress! The twisting post is super helpful to keep it up and helps keep the weight off the earlobe hole. The climbers are still much lighter than I expected! The earrings shipped from Israel so the ship time is real. So happy and can't wait to purchase my bridesmaids' earrings next!,1
"26 Oct, 2018",jleeman2011,The earrings and matching bracelet are lovely and just what I was looking for for my wedding. The pictures do not do the sparkle justice! It is nothing short of amazing.

"11 Aug, 2020",Sarah Sherriffs,"First, Summer is such a great seller. Personable and thoughtful. Second, I've ordered her silver ear climbers twice (because I lost the first pair) and I love them. I think they are a little less heavy then the first set I got, which I really appreciate. I loved the free gift, and I've been eyeing her rings for me. I previously bought my husband's wedding ring from her. I'll definitely buy from her shop again.",1

"27 Aug, 2021",Anna Matrice,"Such a beautiful climber!! It took around three weeks to arrive in Germany and was well worth the wait! As you can see in the picture, my ear lobe is relatively small while the antihelix seems huge. While most other nice climbers I found are just too big for my lobule, the form of this climber fits perfectly (just) :-) Funny story when picking it from the post station: I couldn't wait until I got home, so I unpacked it and threw the packaging into a huge bin. Only to discover that the sachet was empty, despite the business card (it had a hole). So I had to lean far into the bin to catch the packaging with the climber. Even this was well worth it!! Thanks much for creating this beautiful item :-)",0

"25 Feb, 2021",Sandra Busse,"Supersch√∂ner Schmuck, die Perlen glitzern mehr als ich dachte (finde ich aber toll!). Ich musste mir den unteren Teil etwas biegen, da das Ohrl√§ppchen sonst zu hoch steht (ist aber einfach). Der Versand war auch echt schnell :o) Zusatz: Der Ohrrring ist nach wie vor toll, allerdings musste ich eine Einfuhrumsatzsteuer (mit der ich gerechnet habe) von 18‚Ç¨, sowie eine Importabfertigungspauschale von 25‚Ç¨ durch TNT bezahlen. Diese entsteht, wenn TNT f√ºr den Kunden versteuert, unabh√§ngig vom Wert der Ware. Dagegen kann der Empf√§nger klagen, denn er hat diese Leistung nicht beauftragt, aber das ist selten von Erfolg gekr√∂nt. Der Shop kann da nichts f√ºr, denn er beauftragt nur einen Versender in seinem Land, aber ihr als Kunde in Deutschland solltet auf den Versand mit Deutsche Post bestehen, dann k√∂nnt ihr selbst versteuern.",0

"17 Jun, 2020",Kimberly,"The earrings are beeaautiful! Thank you so much for your talent of creating such extraordinary pieces. Can‚Äôt emphasize enough how much I love the design. The earring backs are rubber, which are kind of a disservice to the elegant piece. But I‚Äôll take the compromise for the 24K plating than lower quality plating. Cost, cost, cost. I impart the warning to others to be mentally prepared of VERY delayed shipping during this health crisis. The shipping from Israel to NYC was A MONTH ‚Äî and there were many days where there were no shipping updates whatsoever (not seller‚Äôs fault; 75% delay due to Israel Post and 25% delay due to USPS). That said, her reliable communication helped my eager self to be patient.",0

"28 Jan, 2020",Anaelle Francois,"The earrings are so beautiful! I really love them. The journey to finally have them in my hand was a bit hectic: first, the name of the location of the shop is misleading: the jewellery are actually made and sent from Israel. The cheapest way to send them to me was choosen which ended for the parcel to be lost somewhere in Asia. Luckily I contacted Tommy after a few weeks of patience: he immediately offered to send them back, for free, via UPS. 5 days later they were in my country, waiting for me at the custom. I had to pay an extra charge (keep that in mind depending on where you live), but finally they were mine. They look perfect on me, it was worth all the wait and the extra little tax üôèüèª",0

"06 Mar, 2018",Lucy,"This earring is so beautiful and crafted beautifully, the packaging and note it was delivered with was a really lovely touch and made it feel that extra bit special. For me the earring isn't a great fit however, I have funny shaped ears and no ear lobes so that is why, so something to possibly consider as I've had a nightmare fitting mine and its either uncomfortable of sticking out (this is absolutely down to my ear shape I'm sure). It looks just as described in the picture, and looks more expensive than it was. I love it, I just wish my ear did too.",1
